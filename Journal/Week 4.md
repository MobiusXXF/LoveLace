# Week 4

Talked to Personal Tutor, about the project. We are free to use any model, but it is very convienient to use

Familiarised ourselves with the materials on the Essex Moodle, which includes the dataset we will use, information
on the Agile Workflow and Machine Learning.

Anthony set up the Git Project, and with his experience, assisted the rest of the group in joining the github repo
